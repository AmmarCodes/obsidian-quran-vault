# Obsidian Quran Vault

An initiative to organize the Quran within [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) vault, allowing easier note taking, linking, and referencing.

The current structure doesn't have any links, it's up to you to link Ayat.

The content is built from [`quran-json`](https://github.com/risan/quran-json).

## Usage

Download the [zip file](https://github.com/AmmarCodes/obsidian-quran-vault/releases/) from the latest release, extract its content and place it inside the Obsidian vault.
